# We are proposing that a new variable called CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH be introduced
# to CMake to compliment CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH and CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH.
# A formal feature request has been submited to CMake, Bug #4947.
# It is intended for those users who have common prefixes for their INCLUDE
# and LIBRARY locations. So if users have headers in /usr/local/include
# and libraries in /usr/local/lib, the common prefix is /usr/local.
# It should also cover the case where headers and libraries are
# in the same directory.
# Our proposal expects that FIND_* commands will automatically search for
# CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH right after CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH or CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH.
# Obviously, since CMake does not currently support this, we must write
# our Find*.cmake modules to explicitly support this. Otherwise, this variable
# will have no impact.
# This is unofficial so this may be removed or changed at anytime.
